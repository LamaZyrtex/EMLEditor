# EMLEditor


Heavily based on the fork of SCEditor. The EMLEditor is just a copy of the [SC Editor](https://www.sceditor.com/) by Sam Clarke.

It is a learning project just to se how Typescript could work for the SCEditor.

So many of the js files from the original repository is converted to Typescript.

In my project you will find a package.json, webpack config and things like that to build and bundle the files.
